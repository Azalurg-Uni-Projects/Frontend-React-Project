# Frontend Development Project

This app is strongly inspired by [Opensea.io](https://opensea.io/) platform, but I created my own API server to get the data I want. If you are interested in it check README in the "/backend" folder. All app is to show I can use some of the front-end frameworks, mostly React and Redux. The app has no practical use but feels free to check it out.

<img src="./example-png/1.png" alt="Can't find photo" width=300px>
<img src="./example-png/2.png" alt="Can't find photo" width=300px>

## Instalation
