# Frontend Development Project

This app is strongly inspired by [Opensea.io](https://opensea.io/) platform, but I created my own API server to get the data I want. If you are interested in it check README in the "/backend" folder. All app is to show I can use some of the front-end frameworks, mostly React and Redux. The app has no practical use but feels free to check it out.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./example-png/1.png" alt="Can't find photo" width=300px></td>
    <td><img src="./example-png/2.png" alt="Can't find photo" width=300px></td>
    </tr
    <tr>
      <td><img src="./example-png/4.png" alt="Can't find photo" width=300px></td>
      <td><img src="./example-png/3.png" alt="Can't find photo" width=300px></td>
      <td><img src="./example-png/5.png" alt="Can't find photo" width=300px></td>
